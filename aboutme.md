Hey, my name is Malusi Mwongeli and I'm a cybersecurity researcher at e.Kraal Innovation Hub. I'm mainly focused on red teaming and I am particularly interested in Offensive Infrastructure. This blog is mostly a palce for me to dump stuff I find in my infosec adventures. 

I hope it's helpful to you!
